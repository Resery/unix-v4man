# Typeset the Fourth Research Edition Unix Programmer's Manual
This repository maintains the tools for typesetting and
making available the *Fourth Research Edition Unix Programmer's Manual*.
The generated typeset manual in PDF form is made available
[here](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v4man/index.html).

The manual pages and tools are derived from 1973 material unearthed
by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), and
[made available](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v4/)
through the [The Unix Heritage Society](http://www.tuhs.org/).
I modernized the old shell scripts and corrected some minor markup
glitches through commits that are recorded in this repository.
You can find the evolution of the manual pages recorded in the
[Unix history repository](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo).
Furthermore, you can find the evolution of the corresponding facilities
on a series of tables available
[here](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-history-man/index.html).
